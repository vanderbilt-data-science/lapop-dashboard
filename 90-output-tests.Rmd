# Check Differences Between CSV Output versions

We are refactoring a significant portion of the code base and need to ensure that changes to the final produce data tables change in an understandable way. 

Version 4 lapop_wide_v4.csv is the last version written by the old code base. New versions need to write a file that is the same structure and fundamentally the same data as that one. 

## Compare Version 4 and Version 4

### Read Versions 4 and 5
```{r}
lwv4 <- read_csv("lapop_wide_v4.csv", na = "NULL ") 
lwv5 <- read_csv("lapop_wide_v5.csv", na = "NULL ") 
```

## Compare Columns
```{r}

```

## Find Missing/Added Data

Rows in 4 but Missing in 5
```{r}

```

Rows New in 5
```{r}

```

Data Changed Between 4 and 5
```{r}

```
